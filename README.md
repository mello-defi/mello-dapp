# Mello DeFi - Client Application

There is no one-stop shop for DeFi on Polygon. There is a huge appetite for DeFi but the time commitment needed to access and utilize all the services is high. There are a number of separate services that a user has to learn and understand before accessing DeFi on Polygon. There are many pitfalls and simple mistakes that can easily be devastating, with examples of users losing thousands of dollars. Most of these pitfalls are predictable and just need some simple guardrails in place so as to stop a beginner from becoming a detractor.

Mello v1 combines:
Non-custodial social recovery DeFi wallet
Fiat + crypto onramps
Curve for swaps
Aave for lending/deposits
